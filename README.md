# ADB MRIO processing scripts

The scripts in this repo process the ADB MRIO Excel files and implement various indicators from the input–output and global value chain literature. Download the tables [here](https://kidb.adb.org/globalization) and save each version in a seperate folder under `data/raw`. Run the scripts in the order listed below. All outputs are saved in `data` in parquet format.

| Script | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **Preprocessing**<br>[`01-preprocess-mrios.py`](codes/01-preprocess-mrios.py)| Converts raw Excel files into machine-readable format. |
| **Summary tables**<br>[`02-summary.py`](codes/02-summary.py) | Tabulates key aggregates for each country-sector. |
| **Flows**<br>[`03-flows.py`](codes/03-flows.py) | Computes intermediates, final goods, and value added flows between each country-sector. |
| **Borin–Mancini decomposition**<br>[`04-exports-decomposition.py`](codes/04-exports-decomposition.py) | Performs the Borin and Mancini (2019) exports decomposition at the sector level. |
| **GVC participation**<br>[`05-gvc-participation.py`](codes/05-gvc-participation.py) | Computes the trade-based and production-based GVC participation rates as defined in ADB (2021). |
| **Production lengths**<br>[`06-production-lengths.py`](codes/06-production-lengths.py) | Computes production lengths following the methodology of Wang, Wei, Yu, and Zhu (2017). |
| **Revealed comparative advantage**<br>[`07-revealed-comparative-advantage.py`](codes/07-revealed-comparative-advantage.py) | Computes revealed comparative advantage indices as defined in ADB (2021). |
| **Regional concentration**<br>[`08-regional-concentration.py`](codes/08-regional-concentration.py) | Computes a measure of regional trade concentration inspired by Frankel (1997). |
| **Deflators**<br>[`09-preprocess-deflators.py`](codes/09-preprocess-deflators.py) | Converts raw Excel files into machine-readable format. |
| **Real effective exchange rate weights**<br>[`10-reer-weights.py`](codes/10-reer-weights.py) | Computes real effective exchange rate weights matrices using the Bems and Johnson (2017) and Patel, Wang, and Wei (2019) methodologies. |
| **Real effective exchange rate indices**<br>[`11-reer.py`](codes/11-reer.py) | Computes the weights matrix and the real effective exchange rate index using the Bems and Johnson (2017) and Patel, Wang, and Wei (2019) methodologies. |

## About the MRIO

The Asian Development Bank [Multiregional Input–Output Tables](https://kidb.adb.org/globalization) are a time series of intercountry input–output tables disaggregated into 35 sectors. Final demand are disaggregated into five categories. The following is a schematic of an MRIO table.

Three versions of the tables are currently available:

1. **ADB MRIO 72 countries.** Available for 2017–2022.
1. **ADB MRIO 62 countries.** Available for 2000 and 2007–2022.
1. **ADB MRIO 62 countries constant price.** Values pegged to 2010 prices. Available for 2007–2022.
