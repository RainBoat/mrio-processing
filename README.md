# MRIO Processing Scripts

The ADB Multi-Regional Input-Output Tables are produced by the MRIO team. They are stored in Excel format with plenty of formatting. While this makes them easily readable by humans, they are harder to work with programmatically. Their file sizes are also larger than needed.

The scripts in this repo converts these Excel files into machine-readable format, saved as space-optimal parquet files.
